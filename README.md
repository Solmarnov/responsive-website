# Responsive Website
In this project we will build a custom website using HTML5 and modern CSS techniques such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, psuedo selectors, animation and more. We will also deploy to Netlify and add form functionality.

Created based on [Brad Traversy's](https://github.com/bradtraversy) YouTube video tutorial, [Build a responsive website | HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4&t=158s).
